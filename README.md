## Overview

SysTune is a Termux + root-based system management suite for Mediatek Android devices.  
It provides fine-grained control over charging behavior, automatic system profiles, and real-time monitoring.

SysTune consists of three main modules:

1. **Battery Safe (`battery_safe.sh`)**  
   - Safely manages charging to extend battery life by pausing and resuming charging at configurable thresholds (80%, 90%, 95%, 100%).  
   - Uses kernel-level control, logging, and a status file for tracking.  

2. **Auto Profile (`auto_profile.sh`)**  
   - Automatically switches Termux/system profiles based on battery level or custom triggers.  
   - Profiles are defined in `$MODDIR/config/profile.conf`.  
   - Status is tracked in `$MODDIR/state/auto_profile.status`.  

3. **Terminal Monitor (`sys_monitor.sh`)**  
   - Provides a live terminal-based dashboard showing CPU, memory, battery, and module activity.  
   - Integrates with both Battery Safe and Auto Profile for centralized system status monitoring.
